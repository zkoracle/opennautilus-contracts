= class IBasicTokenContract

Defines the basic interface for a token contract.

All token contracts should inherit from this class and implement its methods.

This class is designed to provide a standardized way of interacting with token contracts, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different implementations.

|Name |Type |Description

m|receiverAddress
m|PublicKey
|The address of the token holder whose tokens will be burned

m|amount

[id="zkoracle_opennautilus-contracts_IBasicTokenContract_deploy_member_1"]
=== deploy()

========

Deploys the token contract to the blockchain.

This method should handle all necessary steps for deploying the contract, such as configuring ownership.


.Signature
[source,typescript]
----
abstract deploy(): Promise<void>;
----

========
[id="zkoracle_opennautilus-contracts_IBasicTokenContract_init_member_1"]
=== init()

========

Initializes the token contract after deployment.

This method is used to perform any additional setup tasks after the contract is deployed, such as setting initial token balances or defining access control rules.


.Signature

----
abstract init(): void;

========
[id="zkoracle_opennautilus-contracts_IBasicTokenContract_mint_member_1"]
=== mint(receiverAddress, amount)

========

|===
|Name |Type |Description

m|receiverAddress
m|PublicKey
|The address of the receiver who will receive the newly minted tokens

m|amount
m|UInt64
|The amount of tokens to mint

s|Returns
m|Promise&lt;void&gt;
|
